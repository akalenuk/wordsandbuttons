## Pages

- [Rational interpolation](https://wordsandbuttons.online/rational_interpolation.html) Rational interpolation is a step forward from polynomial interpolation towards rational splines. With rational interpolation, you can build functions that run through a set of points and also have vertical asymptotes whenever you want. With this capability, you can now model functions like logarithms better.

- [Static typing isn’t free. Where do you think the C++ angry mob comes from?](https://wordsandbuttons.online/static_typing_isnt_free.html) Type inference works like logic deduction so any program in a statically typed language is two programs. The first one is the thing you sell, and the second – is a model that undergoes some sort of verification every time you run a compiler. This second program, although, often being written unknowingly, is not a free bonus, it’s something you have to pay for in several ways.

<sup>[#programming](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_programming.html)</sup> <sup>[#quizzes](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_quizzes.html)</sup> 

- [A picture is worth a thousand tags](https://wordsandbuttons.online/a_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_tags.html) This shows how a picture can be turned into an HTML table. With this, you can not only have nicer tables or uglier pictures, but you can have something that is both at the same time.
<sup>[#demos](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_demos.html)</sup> 

- [Redundant stories about redundancy](https://wordsandbuttons.online/redundant_stories_about_redundancy.html) Component redundancy is used heavily in safety-critical and mission-critical systems for reliability improvement. But outside this niche, it's surprisingly little known in the world of software. Which is a shame since it's a simple but economical idea. It costs nothing to keep in mind, and it saves you a lot on hotfixes and emergency repairs.
<sup>[#programming](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_programming.html)</sup> 

- [Challenge your performance intuition with C++ sine](https://wordsandbuttons.online/challenge_your_performance_intuition_with_cpp_sine.html) One more interactive quiz. This time, it's all about the sine function. Which one is faster and when?
<sup>[#programming](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_programming.html)</sup> <sup>[#quizzes](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_quizzes.html)</sup>

Explains conformal transformations, introduces analytic functions, and shows that analytic complex functions are conformal. And using the connection between the geometry and the analysis explains it all in just some five minutes.
<sup>[#mathematics](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_mathematics.html)</sup> <sup>[#tutorials](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_tutorials.html)</sup>

<sup>[#mathematics](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_mathematics.html)</sup> <sup>[#tutorials](https://wordsandbuttons.online/all_tutorials.html)</sup> 

- [Partial order and non-Boolean logic](https://wordsandbuttons.online/partial_order_and_non_boolean_logic.html) Non-Boolean logics are rare but not extinct. Interval logic is one example. Sometimes, you can implement a logic you want within total order or partial order but sometimes even that isn't enough and you need an even more general relation. With operator overloading, you have the freedom to go there but you also have less assurance when working within the total order.
