  <title>Using logical operators for logical operations is good</title>
  <description>A folow up on a guessing game with C++ operators. Let's redo a few rounds. The benchmark is the same, the questions are the same. The compiler is the same. The only thing that changes is the platform. This is now CHIP with ARMv7.</description>

  <title>Simple image vectorization</title>
  <description>Vectorization is when you take some minecraft-style raster image and make a crisp vector picture out of it. The algorithm describes shows how bilinear interpolation, polynomial approximation, differential analysis, and iterative algorithms work together to solve a practical problem.</description>

  <title>Interactive mnemonics for dot and cross vector products</title>
  <description>Dot and cross vector products are absolutely essential for everything three-dimensional. Whatever 3D thing you do: graphics, printing, physical simulation, — as soon as you want anything beyond what your framework provides, you have to do some vector magic, and these are your most basic spells.

The more embarrassing it is for me to admit. Up until very recently, I couldn't remember which way the cross product goes.</description>

  <title>Lexical differential highlighting instead of syntax highlighting</title>
  <description>“Lexical” since it doesn't need true syntax analysis, primitive tokenization and filtering are enough. And it's “differential” because it aims to highlight the difference between lexemes. Ideally, the smaller the lexical difference, the greater the color difference should be. 
  
It works with any languages. And it saves your traffic.</description>

  <title>[Renovated] Estimating floating point error the easy way</title>
  <description>Unforeseen floating point error is the source of the most unpleasant bugs. The bugs that come and go unpredictably. The bugs that don't reproduce on unit-tests and lay low through the integration phase only to be seen by your most important customer.</description>

  <title>Circles and lines vs. polynomial splines</title>
  <description>Usually, when you want to make a parametric curve, you should go for a polynomial spline. But sometimes, for the reasons mentioned only in the second half of this page to keep you intrigued, you are not satisfied with polynomials. You have to look elsewhere. This page shows you one possible option apart from polynomials and it is an old-school parametric curve made from arcs and line segments stitched together. </description>

  <title>SWInE: Simplicial Weight Interpolation and Extrapolation</title>
  <description>I stole exactly three ideas from other people, made them work together, and gave that compilation a funny name. I had my fun playing with the concept but the conclusion I had to put into my thesis was: “SWInE is rather promising”. In academic language, this means “useless”. However, the three ideas behind the algorithm are prominent. And if an algorithm helps show them in action, then maybe this is what makes the algorithm worthy.</description>

  <title>Challenge your performance intuition with nanosecond sorting</title>
  <description>If the operation you want to speed-up already runs in a few nano-seconds, your reasoning about algorithmic complexity probably wouldn't apply. The most effective algorithms become mediocre while the useless rise from the oblivion to shine and amaze. One of these algorithms is the index sort. It has unconditional O(n2) complexity and this makes it probably the least performant sorting algorithm you never heard about. It's useless on the macro-scale. But on the nano-scale, it excels.</description>

  <title>[Renovated] Logic programming in C++</title>
  <description> When you write in C++ you actually write in two languages at once. First is C++, and the second one is the invisible Prolog. If written properly, the second program is helpful. However, if being neglected, it turns your code into an untangleable mess of incomprehencibles really-really fast. </description>

  <title>[Renovated] Interactive guide to homogeneous coordinates</title>
  <description> Why would you care about homogeneous coordinates, whatever they are? Well, if you work with geometry: 3D-graphics, image processing, physical simulation, — the answer is obvious. Knowing the mathematics behind your framework enables you to write more efficient code.

But even if you don’t work with geometry at all, you still might enjoy learning about projective space and its link to linear algebra. It is an outstanding example of mathematical magic: you pay with a small complication, you gain an enormous simplification in return. </description>

  <title>Error codes are not numbers. But they are. Can we exploit that?</title>
  <description>People do it with different feelings. Sometimes with pride for a clever solution, sometimes with guilt for an obscure hack. Which is odd since there is nothing particularly hacky about it. The ISO/IEC 14882 is ok with it. The IEEE 754 is ok with it. So why is it a hack and not a norm?

I'm talking, of course, about storing return codes in floating-point NaNs. </description>

  <title>[e-book] So You Think You Know C? And TenMore Short Essays on Programming Languages</title>
  <description>Can’t say that running away from complexity was a smart thing to do. It was definitely not the most productive way to create software. The journey, however, has taught me a few things so it was not a complete waste of time either.

This book is a reflection of these lessons. It consists of small essays each about one particular language and one particular insight. They can be read in order but they can be read separately. 

I encourage you to start from the languages you’re the least interested in. I also encourage you to try the actual languages too.

I hope you’ll find this book not too boring, not too trivial, and if nothing else, not too long.</description>
