    <h2>
Who?
    </h2>
    <p>
Hello, I’m Oleksandr Kaleniuk – a Ukrainian software engineer and a failed mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>
Technically, I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_of_Sciences">C. T. S</a> in applied geometry. Which took me five years writing the thesis, publishing papers, speaking at conferences, and doing lots of paperwork. And more paperwork. And even more paperwork. In the end, I had twice as much procedural paperwork as I have published work thesis included. The whole process was a slow burner and eventually, it burned my passion for academia to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
Meanwhile, I was doing all sorts of odd jobs to pay the rent. I’ve been a porter, a journalist, a bassist, a web-designer, and a technical editor for a book on historical metrology. I’ve been programming the whole time too but it wasn't bringing real money back then. One time I wrote a keylogger, no questions asked, for about 10$, and the next month someone stole my internet password with another keylogger and downloaded 8$ worth of porn. That's how I learned both about karma and marginal profit.
    </p>
    <p>
After I got my C. T. S., I came back to my home town in Eastern Ukraine. I’ve been planning to decompress for a while but somehow I landed on a job doing back-end in Erlang for a Turkish gaming site. It was fun and new, and I learned a lot. Unfortunately, the remote work arrangement didn’t work for me. I started bringing work problems home and personal problems to work.
    </p>
    <p>
I quit by Christmas and spent the rest of the winter frying potatoes, playing Borderlands, and watching videos from C++ conferences. By spring, I was suddenly hired by a nuclear power plant automation firm to do research in ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■ and ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■■■■. This was an eye-opening experience. I learned that I have to relearn all the things I learned previously to call myself an engineer. Philosophy and marketing spoiled the software anywhere else, but in safety-critical engineering, you have to let the beliefs go and let the evidence take their place.
    </p>
    <p>
In 2015 I started working for <a href="https://www.materialise.com/en">Materialise</a> in Kyiv. My job now is to make their internal SDK better. It's the sweet spot between math and engineering so it suits me well.
    </p>
    <h2>
What?
    </h2>
    <p>
This is Words and Buttons Online – a growing collection of blah-blah-blah about blah-blah-blah. Ok, I admit it. It's my blog.
    </p>
    <p>
I didn't want it to be a blog though. That's why pages don't have timestamps and authorship attribution.
    </p>
    <p>
But it isn't truly anonymous either. Anonymity isn't the goal. The goal is to give the readers all the value with as little overhead as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
I expect, for 99% of readers the authorship of content is uninteresting and the time of publishing is irrelevant. The remaining 1% can easily get this data via GitHub. But still, the content of this site is vastly dictated by my own interests, my own experience, and my own mistakes, too. It would be dishonest to evade responsibility for them by going 100% anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
So this is a blog with interactive elements but without timestamps and attribution.
    </p>


    <h2>
How?
    </h2>
    <p>
Ah, that's interesting. In a way, this is an experiment in unchitecture. Every page is self-contained: JS, CSS, and HTML bundled together. There are no generators. Pages' sources are pages themselves. There are no external dependencies, no frameworks, no libraries. Just plain JavaScript. There are no internal dependencies either. If I need a piece of functionality I wrote before, I just copy and adapt what I want.
    </p>
    <p>
In terms of modern software architecture, it's a huge step back. And given how well it goes in terms of development and maintainability, I'm starting to believe that the whole field of modern software architecture is a hoax.
    </p>
    <p>
For instance, I ignore OOP completely. The sole purpose of runtime polymorphism is dependency inversion and I don't have dependencies at all.
    </p>
    <p>
I repeat myself, I adore global variables, I eval code, I never sanitize user input, and I repeat myself. For fun and experience, I do all kinds of stuff I wouldn't dare to do for money.
    </p>
    <p>
There's only one rule: every page should be under 64 KB. I believe there is some threshold of complexity that fits in one head and it's all fine while you're still below that threshold. In my case, one simple rule trumps all the established practices.
    </p>

    <h2>
Why?
    </h2>
    <p>
This thing has so many points of agenda I forgot what was supposed to be hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
One thing is absolutely clear though: this is not about business as usual. I do not collect user data, I do not show ads, and I don't do product placement. Weird enough, technically the site is profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
In general, it works like this. I learn something cool, I share it, I get feedback and I get better at what I do. This affects my rate as a contractor and gives material for the talks. And since my expenses are very low, the remuneration for the talks alone covers them with a thick overlap.
    </p>
    <p>
Sometimes, I share something that has no potential for the talks. That's mostly basic math pages that don't bring much to the table. I believe it's still important to do them once in a while as a form of giving back for all the fantastic popular math books I grew on.
    </p>
